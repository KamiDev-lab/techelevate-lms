üöÄ Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>

2. Install dependencies
Install both the backend and frontend dependencies.

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

3. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables. These are crucial for the application to function correctly.

# Database
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# JWT Token
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<your_jwt_secret_key>
JWT_EXPIRE_TIME=1d

# Stripe
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your_stripe_secret_key>
WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_SECRET=<your_stripe_webhook_secret>

# Frontend URL
VITE_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
LOCAL_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Cloudinary (for file uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your_cloudinary_cloud_name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your_cloudinary_api_key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your_cloudinary_api_secret>

# Port
PORT=3000

4. Running the application
Run the backend and frontend servers in separate terminals.

# In the root directory, start the backend server
npm start

# In the frontend directory, start the development server
cd frontend
npm run dev

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:5173 and the API will be running on http://localhost:3000.

‚öôÔ∏è Setting up Stripe Webhooks
The webhook is crucial for updating the payment status.

Get your webhook secret: Go to your Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks.

Add an endpoint:

Endpoint URL: When running locally, use a tool like ngrok or the Stripe CLI to expose your local server. For example: https://<your-ngrok-url>/api/webhook. For production, use your deployed server URL.

Events to send: Select checkout.session.completed.

Copy the secret: After saving, copy the generated webhook secret and paste it into your .env file as WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_SECRET.
